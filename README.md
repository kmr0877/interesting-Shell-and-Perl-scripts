A few interesting shell scripts which we come across in our normal daily life

## _jpg2png.sh_
A shell script jpg2png.sh  converts all images in JPEG format in the current directory to PNG format.

It is  assumed that JPEG files and only JPEG files have the suffix jpg.

If the conversion is succesful the JPEG file should be removed.
